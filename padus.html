<p align="justify">  <font color="white" face="Bell MT" size="3" > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father works as an employee at Union Theological Seminary. I see him as a very hard working person who does not get tired doing everything for his family. He wakes up early in the morning, around 4AM just to go to the market to buy for the things we will be selling. Upon going back, he will accompany me and sometimes my brother too, at the terminal so we can go to school/work. He may not be a perfect father, but for me he is the best.
