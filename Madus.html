<p align="justify">  <font color="white" face="Bell MT" size="3" > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like my father, she is very hard working as well. I would describe her as a woman who is strong. She believes that she should not just depend on my father that is why she works hard at managing our small store so she can provide for the family as well. She really is a selfless person who would always put her family first before herself.
